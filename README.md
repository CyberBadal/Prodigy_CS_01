# Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

A simple implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption algorithm in Python.

## 📜 About

The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest cryptographic algorithms, used by Julius Caesar to protect military messages. This project provides both encryption and decryption functionality with customizable shift values.

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypt/decrypt text strings
- Preserve letter case (uppercase/lowercase)
- Maintain non-alphabetic characters (numbers, symbols, spaces)
- Handle large shift values (automatically wraps around alphabet)
- Simple command-line interface

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/CyberBadal/Prodigy_CS_01.git
2. cd Prodigy_CS_01
3. bash encrypt_decrypt.py

📚 Documentation
Functions
encrypt(text, shift) - Returns encrypted text

decrypt(text, shift) - Returns decrypted text

Both functions:

Accept strings as input

Preserve original character cases

Leave numbers/symbols unchanged
